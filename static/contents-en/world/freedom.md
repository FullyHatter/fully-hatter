You might have thought, "Ha, what kind of title this is! There is no way that I'd want to live like that".

Horiemon, the famous Japanese entrepreneur, also says, "Do whatever you want to do".
Being free is always better than being unfree, right?

Well, I put this title just to make you think that way.
I'm going to say it again:
You should never live freely.

Think of Roger Federer.
(By the way, he is a professional tennis player, and he is like a "living god" in the world of tennis. Imagine him as a tennis-player version of Michael Jordan or Michael Jackson.)

He seems to be able to move across the court and hit the ball quite freely, compared with any other players on the earth.
But let's observe him very carefully.
Is he REALLY moving freely?
Well, I would say NO.
If we think carefully, we will notice how he moves un-freely.

Look at the sophisticated form of his service.
Every time he serves, he takes the exactly the same form, just like it is copied and pasted.
His movements are extremely "unfree".

Movements made by professionals are often extremely unfree, just like his service.
We then find beauty in such movements lacking freedom.

Let's now consider how a baby moves.
A baby seems to enjoy moving,
flapping his hands, kicking his legs up and down, maybe hitting toys lively.

These movements of the baby are extremely "free".
However, with his freedom, what can the baby do?
He can't even keep his feet on the ground by himself.

Are you getting what I want to tell you?

Here is another example.

Let's assume that you are travelling abroad, and decided to go somewhere far by train.
The only things you have with you are your smartphone which is out of service, and a book.

We can say you don't have any freedom,
because you can only move on the train, your smartphone is dead, and the only thing you can do is to read your book.

You might have been a person who is always checking your smartphone, but sadly, it's out of service.

For the time being, you might think of reading the book, even though you are not a kind of person who reads books.

You are now "free" to read the book, because you are in the environment there is no freedom.

Here is still another example, just to make sure.

There is a person who is blind.

We think, he should be quite unfree, because he always needs someone's help whenever he wants to do something.

However, because he can't see, his auditory, olfactory and tactile senses are probably keener than those of anybody else who can see.
For those who can't depend on their sight, the auditory and olfactory senses serve as their "eyes".

For example, they can recognize if it is Shibuya or Shinjuku, how far away they are from the station, just by smelling the scent of the city.

Well, what I want to say is, absence of freedom often opens up a path to freedom.

The real "freedom" is hidden under the skin of its absence.

People may say that absence of freedom is not freedom; but you may be able to find real "freedom" in its absence.
