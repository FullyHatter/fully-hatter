<!-- Tips for Living Better Life -->
<!-- 〜Important Things We Tend to Forget〜 -->

## ■ What you should do:
- Devote yourself into something
- Do something you have never done before
- Do exercise
- Read books
- Talk to people you like

## ■ Do what you love to do.
- At the beginning of a day, plan ahead what you are going to do.
    - Without any plan, all you can do is to do something you have done before. Without any plan and awareness, you just end up following the footsteps you took yesterday.

## ■ What you should avoid doing:
- Never tell a lie. Never say "You are not in the position to tell me that." Jokes are not lies.

◇ Keep a distance from those you don't like.  Based on my rule of thumb, the only one thing you can learn from being with someone you don't like is a realization that there is nothing you can learn from being with someone you dislike.

◇ Never say bad things about anyone.  It becomes a habit.

## ■ When you talk to people:
◇ Say good things about them.  Not too many people dislike someone who says good things about them.  Start from doing it yourself.  Then you will be rewarded unexpectedly! Highly cost effective.

◇ Make them laugh.  This is one of the communication basics, and basics are basically difficult.

◇ Try not to criticize.  Try not so say, "you are wrong", but rephrase it to something like "I understand what you say, but there is another way of looking at it".  Rephrase what you say the way your message is better received. I am going to say this again: never say "You are not in any position to say that".  By the way, arguments are not criticizing.
