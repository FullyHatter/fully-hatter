First of all, this is not a sentence to force you to do something.
This is my personal thought, values ​​and goals.

"Why am I alive?"

I guess everybody will have such a moment in their lives. And many people

"I live to make me happy"

Will conclude. This idea really makes sense.

No matter how hard it may be, people can work hard if they think it is for the happiness of the future.
In the first place, everyone wants to be happier than unhappy.
The approach of reducing unhappy time even more and increasing happy time seems like a good idea in terms of species conservation.

Here, let the goal of your life be "maximize your happy time" for clarity.

Let's say a person with such a goal is on a luxury liner, for example.
It's a big ship with thousands of people on board.
And suppose that big ship hits an iceberg.
The ship is sinking steadily.
The temperature of the seawater is so cold that if the ship sinks, you will be thrown into the sea and die.

The only way to survive is to board a lifeboat.

However, it is a luxurious passenger ship with thousands of people on board.
There is not enough lifeboat for everyone.
More than half of them will die in a few hours.

At this time, what kind of action will be taken if the goal of your life is to maximize your happy time as described above?

Of course, you will try to get on the lifeboat first.
If you die, you can't get happiness anymore.
In order to survive, you must of course push away the girls and children on the lifeboat.

I think this is not beautiful.

With the approach of "being happy," you will never know when to die.
Because if you die you can't feel happy. (maybe)

Therefore, in order to die gracefully in the case of the ship sinking event, you need another approach which is completely different from "happiness".

By the way, the current goal of my life is "die beautifully".
